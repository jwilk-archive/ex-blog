:Subject: Spell-checker for irssi

I tried many spell-checkers for irssi_, and they all sucked (and some
of them were also completely insane_). So I took `the one that seemed
least crazy`_ and forked_ it.

.. _insane: http://irssi-spell.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/irssi-spell/trunk/irssi-spell.pl?revision=5&view=markup#l54

.. _forked: http://jwilk.net/software/irssi-spellcheck
