:Subject: Adequate quality

I present you adequate_, a tool that checks for some common bugs in
packages you have installed on your system. The Debian package comes
with APT hooks, so that you'll be notified (via debconf) every time you
install an adequately-buggy package.

If you don't like broken symlinks, disappearing ``/usr/share/doc/*/``
directories, obsolete conffiles, or ``*.py`` files without corresponding
``*.pyc``, *adequate* is for you.
