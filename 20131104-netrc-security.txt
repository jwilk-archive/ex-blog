:Subject: ~/.netrc security

TL;DR: don't put valuable passwords in ``~/.netrc``

In the olden days, the ``~/.netrc`` file was used for storing FTP
usernames and passwords. These days we have clients of other protocols
that use said file.  Perhaps your IMAP or SMTP client use it. So you put
your e-mail accounts password into ``~/.netrc``, and then meticulously
configured the clients to always connect via TLS and to verify server
certificates. You feel secure.

But you shouldn't. Here's how an attacker capable of MiTM can exploit
``wget`` to steal ``~/.netrc`` passwords:

1\) Alice tries to download a file over HTTP::

   $ wget http://xkcd.com/538/

2\) Eve takes over the HTTP connection, sending a redirection response::

   HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
   Location: http://supersecuremail.example.net/

3\) Alice's ``wget`` follows the redirection.

4\) Eve takes over the connection to supersecuremail.example.net,
requesting password authentication::

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="moo"

5\) Alice's ``wget`` sends the ``supersecuremail.example.net`` password
straight to Eve.
