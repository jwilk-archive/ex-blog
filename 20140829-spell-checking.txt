:Subject: More spell-checking

Have you ever wanted to use Lintian's spell-checker against arbitrary files?
Now you can do it with spellintian_::

   $ zrun spellintian --picky /usr/share/doc/RFC/best-current-practice/rfc*
   /tmp/0qgJD1Xa1Y-rfc1917.txt: amoung -> among
   /tmp/kvZtN435CE-rfc3155.txt: transfered -> transferred
   /tmp/o093khYE09-rfc3481.txt: unecessary -> unnecessary
   /tmp/4P0ux2cZWK-rfc6365.txt: charater -> character

mwic_ (*Misspelled Words In Context*) takes a different approach. It uses
classic spell-checking libraries (via Enchant_), but it groups misspellings and
shows them in their contexts. That way you can quickly filter out
false-positives, which are very common in technical texts, using visual grep::

   $ zrun mwic /usr/share/doc/debian/social-contract.txt.gz
